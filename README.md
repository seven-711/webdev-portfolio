   - Uppercase, italic style
   - Tight line-height (0.95) for dramatic effect
   - Responsive sizing from 2.5rem (mobile) to 5rem (desktop)

2. **Formula Narrow** - Used for body text and descriptions
   - Clean, modern sans-serif
   - Slightly condensed for better readability
   - Font size: 1.25rem with 1.125 line-height

3. **Supply Mono** - Used for UI elements and labels
   - Monospace font for technical feel
   - Uppercase for consistency
   - Font size: 0.875rem for subtle UI text
